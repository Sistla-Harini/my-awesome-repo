collections framework consists of 
1. interfaces: there are the abstract collections
2. implemetations are the concrete implemention classes of these interfaces
3.algorithms are the methods which perform operations such asc searchig sorting.. etc  
                                            collections
         1. set                  2.list                              3.queue                                                     map

sorted list                                                           deque                                                     sorted map

 navigable set                                                                                                                   navigable map
